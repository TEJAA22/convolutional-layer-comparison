Here's a plan you can follow:
   Python Implementation:

Write a Python script (convolution.py) that performs convolution operation on an input matrix.
Use libraries like NumPy to handle matrix operations.
Accept input parameters such as the input matrix, filter/kernel, and padding/striding.
Write test cases to verify the correctness of the implementation.
Create a requirements.txt file listing the dependencies (e.g., NumPy).

    C++ Implementation:

Write a C++ program (convolution.cpp) that performs convolution similar to the Python script.
Implement the convolution operation using basic arithmetic and loops.
Use C++ standard libraries for basic operations.
Use CMake for building the C++ code.
Write test cases to verify the correctness of the implementation.

    Multi-threaded C++ Implementation:

Modify the C++ code to utilize multi-threading for faster execution.
Divide the input matrix into chunks and process each chunk in parallel threads.
Implement synchronization mechanisms (e.g., mutexes) to handle concurrent access to shared resources.
Write test cases to ensure correctness and performance improvement.

    Comparison Script:

Write a Python script (compare.py) to compare the outputs of the Python, C++, and multi-threaded C++ implementations with the golden output.
The script should automatically run all three implementations and compare their outputs.
Print a success or fail message based on the comparison results.

    Documentation:

Create a README.md file detailing the purpose of the project, how to use it, and any dependencies.
Provide clear instructions for running each implementation and the comparison script.
Include sample input data and corresponding golden output for testing purposes.

    GitHub Repository:

Create a GitHub repository to host your project.
Organize the repository with separate directories for each implementation and documentation.
Include license information if applicable.
