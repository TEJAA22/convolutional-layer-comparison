# convolutional-layer-comparison
Convolutional layers are fundamental building blocks in deep learning models, particularly in convolutional neural networks (CNNs). This project provides implementations of a convolutional layer using both Python and C++, allowing for easy comparison of performance and accuracy between the two languages.
